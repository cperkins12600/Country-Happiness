# Evaluating the Factors that go into a Country's Overall Happiness Score
This project uses GDP, Freedom, and Life Expectancy to evaluate a country's overall happiness score.
The 2015.CSV file holds the data used for the project as collected from a website called Kaggle.
The RP-4 file is an R-markdown of the code that contains the MLR forward and backward model and a first-order model alone with the assumptions of the model for the data.
